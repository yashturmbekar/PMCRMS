## Integration Points

### Backend API Integration

All frontend components integrate with backend via `jeWorkflowService`:

**Schedule Appointment Flow:**

```
JEDashboard → jeWorkflowService.scheduleAppointment()
→ POST /api/JEWorkflow/schedule-appointment
→ Backend JEWorkflowController
→ Success: Reload data
```

**Document Approval Flow:**

```
ViewPositionApplication → DocumentApprovalModal
→ jeWorkflowService.verifyDocument() (per document)
→ POST /api/JEWorkflow/verify-document
→ Backend JEWorkflowController
→ Success: Reload application data
```

### Data Fetching

```
JEDashboard:
- getOfficerApplications(userId) → Get assigned applications
- Filter by stage (AppointmentSchedulingByJE, UnderReviewByJE)

ViewPositionApplication:
- getApplication(applicationId) → Full application details
- documents array for approval modal
```

---

## Technical Highlights

### Type Safety

- All API calls typed with TypeScript
- Strict null checking
- Type inference throughout
- No `any` types (all properly typed)

### State Management

- React useState for local state
- Proper async/await patterns
- Loading states
- Error handling

### User Experience

- Loading indicators
- Empty states with meaningful messages
- Success/error alerts
- Auto-reload after actions
- Responsive layouts
- Consistent styling with PMC design system

### Code Quality

- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns
- ✅ Proper component composition
