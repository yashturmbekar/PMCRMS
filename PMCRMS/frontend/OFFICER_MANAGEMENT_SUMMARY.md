## Features Implemented

### Page Header

- Title: "Manage Officers"
- Description: "Manage officer accounts and designations"
- "Invite Officer" button (disabled when all designations are assigned)

### Officer Designations

13 fixed designations (each can be assigned to only ONE officer):

1. JuniorArchitect
2. AssistantArchitect
3. JuniorLicenceEngineer
4. AssistantLicenceEngineer
5. JuniorStructuralEngineer
6. AssistantStructuralEngineer
7. JuniorSupervisor1
8. AssistantSupervisor1
9. JuniorSupervisor2
10. AssistantSupervisor2
11. ExecutiveEngineer
12. CityEngineer
13. Clerk

### Officers Table

Shows only 3 core fields:

- **Name** - with avatar circle showing first letter
- **Email Address** - with mail icon
- **Designation** - displayed as gradient badge with shield icon
- **Actions** - Edit button

### Search Functionality

- Search by name, email, or designation
- Real-time filtering

### Invite Officer Modal

Fields:

- **Full Name** \* (required)
- **Email Address** \* (required)
- **Designation** \* (required - dropdown)

Functionality:

- Dropdown shows only UNASSIGNED designations
- If designation already assigned, it won't appear in dropdown
- When all 13 designations are assigned, invite button is disabled
- On submit: sends invitation with auto-generated password to email

### Edit Officer Modal

Fields:

- **Designation** (read-only, shown as badge)
- **Full Name** \* (editable)
- **Email Address** (read-only with note "Email address cannot be changed")

Functionality:

- Can only edit officer's name
- Designation cannot be changed (fixed once assigned)
- Email cannot be changed (requires backend support)

## User Experience Flow

1. **Admin Dashboard** → Click "Manage Officers" button
2. **Officer List Page** → View all officers
3. **Invite New Officer** → Click "Invite Officer" → Fill form → Select available designation → Submit
4. **Edit Officer** → Click Edit button → Update name → Save
5. **Search** → Type in search bar → Filter results

## Technical Details

### Data Fields Used

- Only using: `name`, `email`, `role` (designation)
- Not using: `employeeId`, `department`, `phoneNumber`, `isActive`, etc.

### Backend Integration

- `adminService.getOfficers()` - Load officers
- `adminService.inviteOfficer()` - Send invitation with auto-generated password
- `adminService.updateOfficer()` - Update officer name

### Design System

- ✅ All PMC CSS classes
- ✅ No Tailwind utilities
- ✅ Gradient cards and badges
- ✅ Consistent with Dashboard.tsx styling

## Key Business Rules

1. **One Officer Per Designation** - Each of the 13 designations can only be assigned once
2. **Auto-Generated Passwords** - System generates and emails password on invite
3. **Fixed Designations** - Cannot change officer's designation after assignment
4. **Email Immutability** - Email address cannot be changed (prevents confusion with auth)

## Success Messages

- ✅ "Officer invited successfully! Password sent to email."
- ✅ "Officer updated successfully!"

## Empty States

- "No officers yet" - when no officers exist
- "Click 'Invite Officer' to add your first officer" - helpful guidance
- "No officers found" - when search has no results

## Future Enhancements (Backend Required)

- Email address updates with password reset
- Cancel/revoke officer access
- View officer activity history
- Bulk operations

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Button text change
2. `frontend/src/pages/admin/OfficerManagementPage.tsx` - Complete redesign
