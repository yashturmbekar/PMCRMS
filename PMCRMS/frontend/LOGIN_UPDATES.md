# Login Page Updates

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to the User Login page to improve security and streamline the authentication process.

## Changes Made

### 1. OTP Validity Period Update

**Change**: Reduced OTP validity from 10 minutes to 5 minutes

**Location**: `LoginPage.tsx` - Line ~517

**Before**:

```tsx
<p className="pmc-help-text">OTP is valid for 10 minutes</p>
```

**After**:

```tsx
<p className="pmc-help-text">OTP is valid for 5 minutes</p>
```

**Rationale**:

- Improved security by reducing the window of opportunity for unauthorized access
- Aligns frontend messaging with backend implementation (backend already set to 5 minutes)
- Industry best practice for OTP expiry times

**Backend Verification**:
The backend `AuthController.cs` (line 99) is already configured with 5-minute expiry:

```csharp
ExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(5), // 5 minutes expiry
```

---

### 2. Removed User Account Creation Section

**Change**: Removed "Create User Account" registration link and related UI elements

**Location**: `LoginPage.tsx` - Lines ~425-437 (removed)

**Code Removed**:

```tsx
{
  /* Registration Link */
}
<div className="pmc-text-center pmc-mt-6 pmc-pt-6 pmc-border-t pmc-border-gray-200">
  <p className="pmc-text-gray-600">
    Don't have an account?{" "}
    <button type="button" className="pmc-text-primary pmc-font-semibold">
      Create User Account
    </button>
  </p>
  <p className="pmc-text-xs pmc-text-gray-500 pmc-mt-2">
    Register to apply for building permits and certificates
  </p>
</div>;
```

**Rationale**:

- Users can only authenticate via OTP (no self-registration)
- Simplifies the login flow and reduces confusion
- Prevents unauthorized account creation
- User accounts are managed administratively

---

## Authentication Flow

### Current Login Process:

1. **Step 1 - Email Entry**:

   - User enters registered email address
   - System sends 6-digit OTP to email
   - Success message displayed

2. **Step 2 - OTP Verification**:
   - User enters 6-digit OTP code
   - OTP must be verified within **5 minutes**
   - Upon successful verification:
     - Token stored in localStorage
     - User redirected to dashboard (or admin panel for admin users)

### Security Features:

- ✅ OTP-based authentication only
- ✅ 5-minute OTP expiry window
- ✅ Email verification required
- ✅ No self-registration (admin-managed accounts)
- ✅ Secure token-based sessions

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:

- Confusing "Create User Account" button that didn't work
- Misleading 10-minute validity message (backend was already 5 minutes)
- Mixed messaging about registration capabilities

### After:

- Clean, straightforward login flow
- Accurate OTP validity information
- No registration confusion
- Clear authentication process

---

## Testing Checklist

### OTP Validity Testing:

- [ ] Request OTP and verify it arrives via email
- [ ] Verify OTP within 5 minutes - should succeed
- [ ] Wait 5+ minutes and try to verify OTP - should fail with expiry message
- [ ] Request new OTP after expiry - should work correctly

### UI Testing:

- [ ] Verify "Create User Account" section is completely removed
- [ ] Confirm "OTP is valid for 5 minutes" message displays correctly
- [ ] Check that email entry form functions properly
- [ ] Verify OTP entry form functions properly
- [ ] Test "Resend OTP" functionality

### Browser Compatibility:

- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

## Related Files

### Modified Files:

- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Login UI updates

### Backend Files (No Changes Required):

- ✅ `backend/PMCRMS.API/Controllers/AuthController.cs` - Already configured with 5-minute expiry
- ✅ `backend/PMCRMS.API/Services/EmailService.cs` - Email template already shows "Valid for 5 minutes"

---

## Impact Analysis

### User Impact:

- **Low Impact**: Changes improve clarity and security
- Users will notice:
  - Correct OTP validity messaging (5 minutes instead of 10)
  - No "Create User Account" button (removes confusion)

### System Impact:

- **No Breaking Changes**: Backend already enforced 5-minute expiry
- **Frontend-only changes**: No API modifications required
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality unchanged

---

## Security Considerations

### Improved Security:

1. **Shorter OTP Window**: 5-minute expiry reduces attack surface
2. **No Self-Registration**: Prevents unauthorized account creation
3. **Consistent Messaging**: Frontend now matches backend behavior

### Security Best Practices Applied:

- ✅ Time-limited OTPs
- ✅ Centralized user management
- ✅ Clear authentication flow
- ✅ No ambiguous registration options
